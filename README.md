# A library for implementing Convolutional Neural Networks
Small, lightweight, and optimised library for custon CNN for image classification.

# TODO
 - Image -> Bitmap formatting
 - Create basic layers
 - Pooling layers
 - Activation layers
 - Saving a model (JSON or binary?)
 - Getting it running on a GPU
 - Getting it running on a cluster
